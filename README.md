# CI/CD Project for AWS Lambda Functions
This project provides a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for managing AWS Lambda functions. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, using AWS services and infrastructure-as-code tools.

# Overview
The CI/CD pipeline utilizes the following technologies and tools:

AWS Lambda: Serverless compute service for running code without provisioning or managing servers.
AWS CodePipeline: Fully managed continuous delivery service for orchestrating the CI/CD workflow.
AWS CodeBuild: Fully managed build service for compiling, testing, and packaging code.
AWS CloudFormation: Service for provisioning and managing AWS resources using infrastructure-as-code templates.
AWS IAM: Identity and Access Management service for managing user access and permissions.
AWS S3: Simple Storage Service for storing deployment artifacts and other files.
AWS Secrets Manager: Service for securely storing and managing secrets, such as API keys or database credentials.
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language): Human-readable data serialization format used for defining CI/CD pipeline workflows.
Terraform: Infrastructure-as-code tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

src/: Directory containing the source code of the AWS Lambda functions.
tests/: Directory containing unit tests for the Lambda functions.
.github/workflows/: Directory containing YAML files defining the CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions.
terraform/: Directory containing Terraform configuration files for provisioning AWS resources.
CI/CD Workflow
The CI/CD workflow consists of the following stages:

# Source: 
Whenever changes are pushed to the repository, the CI/CD pipeline is triggered.
Build: The pipeline uses AWS CodeBuild to compile the Lambda function code, run tests, and create deployment artifacts.
Deploy: The pipeline uses AWS CloudFormation and Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure, such as Lambda functions, IAM roles, and any other required resources.
# Cleanup: 
After successful deployment, the pipeline cleans up any temporary resources or artifacts.
Notifications: Notifications or alerts can be configured to inform stakeholders about the status of the deployment.
# Getting Started
To get started with this CI/CD project, follow these steps:

Set up AWS credentials: Configure AWS credentials with appropriate permissions to create and manage Lambda functions, IAM roles, S3 buckets, CloudFormation stacks, and other required resources.
Set up Terraform: Install Terraform and configure it to work with your AWS account.
Update AWS resources: Update the Terraform configuration files in the terraform/ directory to define the desired AWS resources and configurations for your project.
Define workflows: Update the YAML files in the .github/workflows/ directory to define your CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions. Customize the workflow triggers, steps, and integration with AWS services as per your requirements.
Configure secrets: Use AWS Secrets Manager or GitHub repository secrets to securely store any sensitive information required for the pipeline, such as API keys or database credentials.
Push changes: Commit and push your changes to the repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline and start the deployment process.
